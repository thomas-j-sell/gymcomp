Gym companion app for Pebble

App can be installed on a Pebble smartwatch using Pebbles developer tools.  This requires the Pebble SDK to be installed on your computer.  (See http://developer.getpebble.com)

Currently exercises are hard-coded.  A companion phone app could eventually be used to set up workouts, allow you to switch between saved workouts, etc.

Usage:

The select button toggles between view and edit modes.

Depending on the mode, the up and down buttons either switch between exercises, or increment/decremet the weight of the current exercise.
